# Aid Worker Security Incidents BI Report

This interactive Power BI report presents major security incidents affecting humanitarian personnel worldwide, using data from the [Aid Worker Security Database (AWSD)](https://www.aidworkersecurity.org/). It supports self-directed exploration of nearly three decades of AWSD records.

## Report Structure

The report is organised into five pages, each designed to support a specific stage of data exploration:

| Page | Description |
|---|---|
| **Home** | Introduction, data background, key definitions, and a long-term incident trend chart |
| **Global Overview** | Temporal trends, geographic distribution, top affected countries, year-on-year comparison |
| **Attacks & Perpetrators** | Attack means, context, settings, perpetrator types, and motives — with a cross-country comparison matrix |
| **Victims** | National vs. international staff, gender distribution, organisation type, and outcome breakdown |
| **Data Exploration** | Open-ended decomposition tree for user-driven breakdown across any combination of dimensions |

## Data Architecture

The data warehouse architecture runs entirely within **Microsoft Fabric**. The solution is organized as a master pipeline that orchestrates four sub-pipelines, each responsible for a specific stage of the data processing workflow. The workflow follows the Medallion architecture pattern (Bronze → Silver → Gold), progressively refining raw API data into analytically optimised dimension and fact tables.
The diagram below shows the end-to-end flow:

<br>


The table below summarises the role of each pipeline component:
| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| **Source Ingestion Pipeline** | Retrieves incident records daily from the AWSD API (JSON) into the Lakehouse — no transformation, source structure preserved |
| **Curation & Staging Load Pipeline** | Deduplicates, preprocesses, and standardises Lakehouse data; loads dimension and fact tables into the staging area |
| **Data Validation & Quality Assurance Pipeline** | Runs 5 quality rules in parallel — business key uniqueness, attribute uniqueness, referential integrity |
| **Data Warehouse Load Pipeline** | Loads validated staging data into the dimensional model; generates surrogate keys and resolves foreign keys |
| **Failure Notification Pipeline** | Sends an automated alert if any pipeline fails — enables early issue detection without manual monitoring |


The semantic model sits on top of the data warehouse and prepares the data for reporting in Power BI. It follows a star schema based on Kimball's dimensional modelling methodology. The grain is one row per recorded security incident. Measures include counts of affected individuals (killed, wounded, kidnapped, detained), disaggregated by nationality status, organisation type, and gender. Nine dimension tables provide analytical context — Date, Location, Attack Context, Attack Means, Incident Setting, Motive, Perpetrator Type, Source, and Verification Status. See the semantic model's diagram below:
